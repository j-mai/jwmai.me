        <li> are 3x faster in water than on land? </li>
        <li> only sleep about 10 hours a day? </li>
        <li> bask in the sun to raise their temperatures because they cannot shiver? </li>
        <li> are nocturnal? </li>
        <li> can live up to 40 years old? </li>

      <h2> The sloth's slowness is actually an evolutionary adaptation!
      Their predators (especially the harpy eagle) can perceive very tiny movements, so the slow movements of a sloth
      help it blend in with their surroundings! </h2>
